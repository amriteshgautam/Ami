<h4>What is version control?</h4>
<p>Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.</p>

<h4>THREE COMMANDS USED IN GIT</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Git clone <br>Git cloneis primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new directory, at another location. The original repository can be located on the local filesystem or on remote machine accessible supported protocols. The git clonecommand copies an existing Git repository.</li>
  <li>Git commit<br>
  The git commit command saves all currently staged changes of the project. Commits are created to capture the current state of a project. Committed snapshots are considered safe versions of a project because Git asks before changing them.


  </li>
  <li>Git push<br>The git pushcommand is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo. It's the counterpart to git fetch, but whereas fetching imports commits to local branches, pushing exports commits to remote branches
  </li>
